# Exercise-1
QA API SUT


This project tests the genderize.io API using different endpoints


An example of genderizing a single name could look like this.

GET https://api.genderize.io/?name=peter



It uses the JSON-Simple.jar.


1st test inputs an invalid parameter to name in order to verify the return values from the API

2nd test uses valid data

3rd test uses two endpoints and if verifies the second one from the predefined tests values.
